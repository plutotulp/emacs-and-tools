* emacs-and-tools
Personal Emacs setup and collection of tools I'd expect to be present,
in Nix flake form.

Enable by importing ~nixosModules.default~ from this flake and setting
~config.programs.emacs-and-tools.enable~ in your NixOS configuration.

Lots of dependencies included. Starts systemd user service
~emacs.service~ on user login.

This flake includes a NixOS integration test verifying that the user
service actually starts up successfully on login. Just run
~nix flake check~.
